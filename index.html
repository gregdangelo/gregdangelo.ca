			<h2>My Process</h2>
			<div class="grid_4 alignright left alpha">
				<h3 >Step 1:</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="grid_8 omega">
			<h3>Research</h3>
			<p>Before I put a pencil to paper I like to get some information about a web project.  These are just a few options I consider:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What's the end goal?</li>
				<li>Who is the target audience?</li>
				<li>What are competitors or similar sites doing?</li>
				<li>Will the site have frequent updates?</li>
			</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="grid_4 alignright left alpha"><h3 >Step 2:</h3></div>
			<div class="grid_8 omega">
			<h3>Sketch</h3>
			<p>No rulers, no grids just freeform drawings and scribbles.</p>
			<p>This helps me play around with a design before I start and rule things out that just won't work.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="grid_4 alignright left alpha"><h3 >Step 3:</h3></div>
			<div class="grid_8 omega">
			<h3>Digital Design</h3>
			<p>This is where I jump into Fireworks or Photoshop.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="grid_4 alignright left alpha"><h3 >Step 4:</h3></div>
			<div class="grid_8 omega">
			<h3>HTML Mockup</h3>
			<p>Using the same Grid system I am able to quickly mockup pages into HTML.  This prep work for the next step but really gets me thinking how the page should be created for best results in terms of rendering, speed, and SEO. If I know that the site might be viewed on a mobile device I take the appropriate steps to optimize it for smaller screens and browser cache.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="grid_4 alignright left alpha"><h3 >Step 5:</h3></div>
			<div class="grid_8 omega">
			<h3>CMS Theme creation</h3>
			<p>If the website is going to use a CMS I take my HTML mockups and work them into the CMS' templating system.  At this stage I may sometimes go back and make minor adjustments to the design to account for anything that doesn't work as well in practice as it does in a mockup.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="grid_4 alignright left alpha"><h3 >Step 6:</h3></div>
			<div class="grid_8 omega">
				<h3>Browser Love</h3>
				<p>This is where I take care of browser specific problems and nuances.  The majority of the time this is inclusively IE fixes.  This also includes any CSS3 browser specific updates. Generally I code things first for Firefox then move onto Webkit based browsers and so on.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="grid_12 section" id="extra-know">
			<h2>Did You Know?</h2>
			<div class="grid_4 alignright left alpha">
				<h3>Analytics</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="grid_8 omega">
				<h3>Google</h3>
				<p>By utilizing Event Tracking you can see if some of that cool javascript you added is even being used.</p>
				<p>You can track downloads of PDFs, images and anything else and then find out how they got to the download by using Funnel Visualization.</p>
				<p>There's a PHP version of analytics that you can use to track mobile devices.  This is great for devices like older Blackberrys that have Javascript turned off by default.</p>
				<h3>Behavioural Targeting</h3>
				<p>You can use tools like <a href="http://btbuckets.com/" target="_blank">BTBuckets</a> to filter content to users based on things such as keywords that they used to find you website.</p>
				<p>You can even roll your own targeting if you have the time.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="grid_4 alignright left alpha">
				<h3>HTML</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="grid_8 omega">
				<h3>CSS</h3>
				<p>You should always load this at the top of your page, if not, browsers like IE will display a white screen until all stylesheets are downloaded</p>
				<p>Using a grid helps speed up the process as well as keeps things clean and consistent.  Also just because you use a grid doesn't mean all your designs have to be square.</p>
				<h3>Javascript</h3>
				<p>Javascript is awesome but if your site(s) is used mostly by IE users you may want to limit how much you use it.</p>
				<p>If you are not using a JS framework then you really should start.  I'm using jQuery here but you could use <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/" target="_blank">Prototype</a>, <a href="http://mootools.net/" target="blank">Mootools</a>, <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/" target="_blank">Dojo</a>, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/" target="_blank">YUI</a> even Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/closure/" target="_blank">Closure Tools</a>.</p>
				<p>If you try and keep all your Javascript at the bottom of your webpage it will load faster.  You may also want to consider minifying, combining scripts and using a CDN.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="grid_4 alignright left alpha">
				<h3>Design</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="grid_8 omega">
				<h3>Web UI</h3>
				<p>Design for the web is <strong>always</strong> changing and so you have to keep up with some of the latest ideas and technology, for example CSS3.</p>
				<p>A <strong>DOCTYPE</strong> tag should precede your <strong>HTML</strong> tag to tell the browser how to render your webpage.</p>

				<h3>Thanks!</h3>

			<div class="grid_8 omega">
				<h3>Pixlr</h3>
				<p>An advanced online image editor.</p>
				<p>I used their chrome extension (<a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/cjjghkapdciaiogkeofggpblmbbnjinn" target="_blank">Pixlr Grabber</a>) to grab all of my screenshots and then did my editing and cropping on <a href="http://pixlr.com/">Pixlr.com</a><p>
				<h3>jQuery</h3>
				<p>I love using <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a> when it comes to editing the DOM.  If you can write CSS then you can use jQuery and vice versa.</p>
				<h3>960 Grid System</h3>
				<p>Since I've started using this my development time has decreased significantly and my designs are looking cleaner than ever.  I recommend checking out <a href="http://960.gs" target="_blank">960.gs</a> if you haven't yet.</p>

			<img src="/images/flyhi.jpg" class="right" width="320"/>
			<h3>Hamilton International Airport</h3>
			<a href="http://flyhi.ca" target="_blank">flyhi.ca</a>
<p>This site was developed using a series of Photoshop files.  The site integrates data from a variety of sources to provide both current weather and flight information.</p>
<p>Advanced analytics tracking and segmentation were added to further understand the market segments that are using the website.  Based on those results it was clear that there was a need for a mobile version of the site for handheld devices, including cell phones, iPhones and Blackberries.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="port-bigb">
			<img src="/images/bigb.jpg" class="right" width="320"/>
			<h3>Big B Comics</h3>
			<a href="http://www.bigbcomics.com" target="_blank">bigbcomics.com</a>
			<p>The site was newly created in conjuction with a professional illustrator.  The framework and content were created by using the information sent to me by the client and the graphics created by the illustrator.</p>
			<p>WordPress was used as the content management system, something the client was familiar with.  Custom code was written to allow the client to maintain and update almost every aspect of the site.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="port-simply">
			<img src="/images/simply.jpg" class="right" width="320"/>
			<h3>Simply Audiobooks</h3>
			<a href="http://www.simplyaudiobooks.com/" target="_blank">simplyaudiobooks.com</a>
			<p>Though most of the work on this site was strictly backend, I did recreate the sign-up process.  It was turned from a static form to a multi-part dynamic process.  From back-end controls a high level admin could rearrange at which stage a component, such as phone number, would appear in the process.</p>
			<p>This redesign of the sign-up also included the use of adwords and other variables for the dynamic rendering of a user specific pricing matrix.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="port-enchantee">
			<img src="/images/enchantee.jpg" class="right" width="320"/>
			<h3>Enchantee</h3>
			<a href="http://enchantee.ca/" target="_blank">enchantee.ca</a>
			<p>This site was created using a custom Wordpress theme according to the clients specifications.  The theme uses advanced stylings that were made to be cross browser compliant.</p>
			<p>The actual html for the header of the website is between the content and the footer.  This allows for search engines to read the content before hitting the navigation which helps with keywords and pagerank</p>
		</div>
		<div id="port-biox">
			<img src="/images/biox.jpg" class="right" width="320"/>
			<h3>Biox</h3>
			<a href="http://www.bioxcorp.com/" target="_blank">bioxcorp.com</a>
			<p>Major work was done to give the client control over their main website banner which includes video .  They also had to be able to control it from their current admin panel and with the help of jQuery and AJAX it was made possible.</p>
			<p>Other work includes updgrades to the backend WSIWYG editor.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="port-starward">
			<img src="/images/starward.jpg" class="right" width="320"/>
			<h3>Starward</h3>
			<a href="http://starwardhomes.com/" target="_blank">starwardhomes.com</a>
			<p>Advanced analytics and segmentation were implemented on their existing website to better understand how their site was being navigated.</p>
			<p>A touchscreen application for a 52" interactive sales kiosk was created that is used to help sales people in their selling process as well as offer a <em>WOW</em> factor to potential customers.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="port-starcommunity">
			<img src="/images/starcommunity.jpg" class="right" width="320"/>

		</div>
		<div id="port-pcyc">
			<img src="/images/pcyc.jpg" class="right" width="320"/>
			<h3>PCYC</h3>
			<a href="http://pcyc.net/" target="_blank">PCYC.net</a>
			<p>This job was originally a port from their old static website to Wordpress, however because of the size of their previous website I opted to use Wordpress MU instead of standard Wordpress.  This decision gave them more control and allowed them to have a more defined user authorization.</p>
			<p>New plugins were created to facilitate user management across the Wordpress installation.  Steps were taken through custom plugins and themeing to help make the site even easier to use.  Time was also spent training the client in the use and editing of site content</p>
		</div>
		<div id="port-eneruse">
			<img src="/images/eneruse.jpg" class="right" width="320"/>
			<h3>EnerUse</h3>

			<h3>Sylvite</h3>
			<a href="http://sylvite.ca/" target="_blank">sylvite.ca</a><br/>
			<a href="http://www.sylviteamericas.com/" target="_blank">sylviteamericas.com</a>
			<p>The Sylvite America's site was created based on the Sylvite site and utilized the same content management system.  Both the Spanish and English versions of the site share the same database but can be edited seperately.</p>
			<p>For Sylvite.ca, flash updates and reworks were done, along with other changes to the site to improve overall usability.</p>
